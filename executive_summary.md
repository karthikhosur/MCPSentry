# 1. MCPSentry
**Logo:** [MCPSentry Shield Logo]
**Tagline:** Securing the Next Generation of AI Tool Interactions

# 2. Vision
MCPSentry will be the security foundation that enables trust in the AI tool ecosystem, becoming as essential as SSL certificates are to websites today. We're building the critical infrastructure to secure the explosive growth of AI tools, empowering innovation while protecting against emerging threats.

# 3. The Problem
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has revolutionized how AI models interact with external tools, but this rapidly growing ecosystem faces critical security vulnerabilities as highlighted in Anthropic's official MCP documentation:

* **Creation Phase Risks:** Name collision attacks, installer spoofing, backdoors
* **Operation Phase Risks:** Tool name conflicts, command overlap, sandbox escape
* **Update Phase Risks:** Privilege persistence, vulnerable version deployment, configuration drift

With no centralized verification process, organizations deploying MCP servers face significant security threats that could compromise sensitive data and systems.

# 4. The Customer
**Primary Customers:**
* **Enterprise AI Teams:** Deploying AI agents with tool integration needs
* **MCP Server Developers:** Building integration tools for the AI ecosystem
* **AI Platform Providers:** Offering MCP-compatible environments

**Go-To-Market Strategy:**
* Developer community engagement through top MCP server collections like MCP.so and Glama.ai which serve as central directories for MCP servers
* Strategic partnerships with leading AI platforms (Anthropic, OpenAI)
* Direct enterprise outreach to early MCP adopters in finance and technology

# 5. The Solution
MCPSentry will provide the first comprehensive security marketplace for MCP servers:

* **Automated Security Scanning:** Detecting critical vulnerabilities before deployment
* **Namespace Protection:** Preventing impersonation and collision attacks
* **Trust Registry:** Verifying developer identities with cryptographic assurance
* **Curated Marketplace:** One-click installation of verified servers

**Why Now:** MCP was released by Anthropic in late 2024 as an open standard and has seen rapid adoption across multiple platforms, creating urgent need for security standards as enterprise adoption accelerates.

# 6. Market Size
The AI agents market is projected to grow from $5.4 billion in 2024 to $47.1 billion by 2030 at a CAGR of 44.8% according to market research from both Grand View Research and MarketsandMarkets.

* **North America:** 40% market share, with the region holding the largest share in 2024 due to technological advancement and early AI adoption
* **Enterprise Security Segment:** Approximately 24% of total market
* **Immediately Addressable Market:** Estimated $900 million annually

# 7. Market Landscape
**Current Ecosystem:**
* Thousands of MCP servers across multiple community platforms with over 3,000 servers available and growing
* Major community directories include MCP.so, Glama.ai (hosting over 3,000 servers), and PulseMCP which serve as central repositories
* No existing security-focused solution despite rapid growth

**Our Insight:** A recent article noted that "MCP servers are everywhere right now... a new one pops up" daily, yet there's "little to no governance" highlighting the urgent need for security verification.

**Competition:**
* Community directories offer no comprehensive security verification
* Client-specific tools provide only basic checks
* No existing solution combines verification, prevention, and monitoring

# 8. Traction
**Pre-Product Validation:**
* Stakeholder interviews with MCP developers and enterprise users
* Security research validating the vulnerability framework
* Conceptual testing of scanning methodology with security experts

**Planned Milestones:**
* Month 3: MVP launch with basic vulnerability detection
* Month 6: 100+ active beta users, 3-5 pilot enterprise customers
* Month 12: Public marketplace with 1,000+ MCP servers

# 9. Business Model
**Developer-Friendly Pricing:**
* **Free Tier:** Full security scanning for up to 5 MCP servers
* **Developer Shield:** $10/month per user for early adopters
* **Team Shield:** Volume discounts for development teams
* **Enterprise Solutions:** Custom pricing starting at $2K/month

**Revenue Projections:**
* Month 6 post-launch: Initial revenue from early adopters
* Month 12 post-launch: $500K ARR target
* Year 2: $3M+ ARR with expanded API integration offerings

# 10. Team
